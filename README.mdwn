cryptapult
===========

Goal
----

This is aimed at KeyASIC hardware, so the final goal is having something that:
* "observe" if you create a photo on your sd card
* encrypts it in a separate partition (throwing it away like a catapult)
* wipe the original

By now, there is only some code about encryption

Implementation
-----------------

Of course the difficult part is the encryption: we use libsodium to do the hard
stuff. 

In development, attention is paid to:
* compatibility with both glibc and uclibc
* ability to create static binaries
