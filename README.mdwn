What's this
============

A small program to perform *quick* asymmetric encryption, aimed at embedded
devices. It relies on [nacl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) to do the hard stuff.

Some attention is paid to keep compatibility with non-gnu toolchains.

Compile
=======
By now, it uses tweetnacl: just download it from its website.

Migration to libsodium is a future goal, making it possible to use
niceness such as crypto_box_seal.
